# Welcome

Parca is a continuous profiling project for applications and infrastructure. It helps you save money, improve performance and understand incidents better.

Continuous profiling is the act of taking profiles (such as CPU, Memory, I/O and more) of programs in a systematic way. Parca collects, stores and makes profiles available to be queried over time. It features a powerful multi-dimensional data model, storage and query engine specifically designed for profiling data.
